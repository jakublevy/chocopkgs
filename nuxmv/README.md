# nuXmv
nuXmv is a new symbolic model checker for the analysis of synchronous finite-state and infinite-state systems.

nuXmv extends NuSMV along two main directions:
* For the finite-state case, nuXmv features a strong verification engine based on state-of-the-art SAT-based algorithms.
* For the infinite-state case, nuXmv features SMT-based verification techniques, implemented through a tight integration with MathSAT5.
