## New Configuration
We have also switched to a much more modular approach for info segments, this simplified the code and made it easier to add new info segments. This change also allows users to add custom info segments in their config. The [default config](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch/blob/v2.0.0/winfetch.ps1#L205) has been updated, see the [configuration docs](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch/wiki/Configuration) for more information.

If you never used `winfetch -genconf` before then you should automatically be switched to the new config, otherwise, you can regenerate a new config with `winfetch -genconf`.
Optionally, you can attempt to migrate your old configuration, this [commit](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch/commit/5ec703568f9040a90af067ee69db3c9bc6a08253#diff-dcc6f40140e4baaca49d437e768c7f8b2dc1d58d6fcb4a27a1cb0f7473ffe5ff) may help.

## Benchmarks
There have been many improvements to speed since `v1.2.0`. Comparing `v1.2.0` to `v2.0.0` with the same segments enabled `1500ms` -> `350ms` which is around a `4x` improvement. More details can be seen on the [winfetch vs neofetch](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch/wiki/Winfetch-vs-Neofetch) benchmarks.
