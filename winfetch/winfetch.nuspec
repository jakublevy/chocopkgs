Winfetch is a command-line system information utility written in PowerShell 5+. Winfetch displays information about your operating system, software and hardware in an aesthetic and visually pleasing way.

The overall purpose of Winfetch is to be used in screenshots of your system. Winfetch shows the information other people want to see. There are other tools available for proper system statistic/diagnostics.

The information by default is displayed alongside your operating system's logo. You can further configure Winfetch to instead use an image, your wallpaper or nothing at all.

According to benchmarks done with Hyperfine, Winfetch on Windows is faster than Neofetch running on Bash emulators like MSYS (Git Bash) or Cygwin.

<releaseNotes>
### Fixed
* Fixed errors when using strict-mode
* Fixed errors when using `-noimage`
* Fixed issues with image processing especially for larger images
* Fixed detailed help not showing

### New Features
* Improved terminal detection
* Improved scoop pkgs speed
* Disable unused package managers, use `-showpkgs [enabled pkgs]`
* Change the order of info segments
* Insert blank info lines
* Hide the colorbar
* Colorbar now shows 16 colors
* Add [custom info segments](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch/wiki/Configuration#custom-info-segments) in the config
* Info lines are now written out progressively
* Info segments can now display multiple lines
* Show info for multiple disks, use `-showdisks *`
* Added legacy windows logo, use `-switchlogo` to use the alternate logo
* Added `-all` parameter to show all built-in info segments (regardless of your config)
* Added `-stripansi` parameter to disable colors/fancy formatting similar to `--stdout` in neofetch
* Added `-configpath` parameter and `WINFETCH_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to override the default location of the config
* Command-line parameters will now override those set in the config
* Long lines will now be truncated instead of wrapping to the next line
* Added a basic [legacy](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch/tree/legacy) branch for systems older than Windows 7
* The default config is now embedded within winfetch.ps1 and is generated automatically if your config doesn't exist
* Added percentage bars to cpu, memory, disk and battery, they are configured similar to neofetch, for example, use `winfetch -cpustyle bar -diskstyle textbar`

### New Info
* kernel
* resolution
* motherboard
* battery
* local_ip
* public_ip
* cpu_usage
* locale
* theme

### New Configuration
We have also switched to a much more modular approach for info segments, this simplified the code and made it easier to add new info segments. This change also allows users to add custom info segments in their config. The [default config](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch/blob/v2.0.0/winfetch.ps1#L205) has been updated, see the [configuration docs](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch/wiki/Configuration) for more information.

If you never used `winfetch -genconf` before then you should automatically be switched to the new config, otherwise, you can regenerate a new config with `winfetch -genconf`.
Optionally, you can attempt to migrate your old configuration, this [commit](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch/commit/5ec703568f9040a90af067ee69db3c9bc6a08253#diff-dcc6f40140e4baaca49d437e768c7f8b2dc1d58d6fcb4a27a1cb0f7473ffe5ff) may help.

### Benchmarks
There have been many improvements to speed since `v1.2.0`. Comparing `v1.2.0` to `v2.0.0` with the same segments enabled `1500ms` -> `350ms` which is around a `4x` improvement. More details can be seen on the [winfetch vs neofetch](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch/wiki/Winfetch-vs-Neofetch) benchmarks.
