# vlna
Program vlna adds ties (Czech vlna or vlnka) after nonsyllabic prepositions
(instead of spaces) in the TeX source files. This prevents line breaks
at undesirable spaces.
## Preface
There  exists  a  special  Czech  and Slovak typographical rule: you cannot leave the non-syllabic preposition on the end of one line and continue writing text on next  line.  For
example, you cannot write down the text "v lese" (in a forest) like "v[new-line]lese". The
program vlna adds the ASCII tilde between such preposition and the next  word  and  removes
the  space(s) in this place.  It means the program converts "v lese" to "v~lese". You can
use this program as a preprocessor  before TeXing. Moreover, you can set  another  sequence
to store instead ASCII tilde (see the -x option).

## Options
The options are optional and can be written in arbitrarty order separated by space.
```
-f     Filter. The [filenames] are treated as follows:

        vlna -f filename1 filename2
            Input is filename1, output is filename2.

        vlna -f filename1
            Input is filename1, output is stdout.

        vlna -f
            Input is stdin, output is stdout.

        vlna filename1 [filename2 [filename3 ...]]
            If the -f option is omitted then each file is processed independently and it is
            re-written.

-s     The silent mode. No messages, warnings, statistics are printed.  Only errors  which
        terminates  the  program  untimely  are printed.  If this parameter is omitted then
        banner, warnings and statistics are printed to stderr.

-r     Do not create the backups. The option -r is irrelevant if the -f option is used. If
        the  -f  and  -r  options  aren't used then each re-written file is stored with its
        original contents to a backup file  (the  name  of  backup  file  is  the  same  as
        filename, only the tilde is used instead of the last character).

-v characters
        The  set  of  characters  treated  as non-syllabic prepositions is declared by this
        option. Default:  -v KkSsVvZzOoUuAI.   The  space  between  -v  and  characters  is
        required.

-x code
        The  code  is  a  string  written  in  hexadecimal  notation  (even  hexa digits is
        required). This string will be saved after prepositions instead asciitilde which is
        default.   The  example:  -x  C2A0  two  bytes  are  stored after each non-syllabic
        preposition, first byte has C2 code and second byte has A0 code. This example means
        that  NO-BREAK  SPACE  in  UTF8  encoding will be used after prepositions.  Another
        example: -x 00A0 the  NO-BREAK  SPACE  in  UTF16  encoding.   Another  example:  -x
        48454C4C4F  the  string  HELLO  will  be  used.   The  space between -x and code is
        required.

-m     The math-modes ($...$  and  $$...$$)  are  ignored.   It  means  that  non-syllabic
        prepositions is searched in math-mode too.  Default (without -m option): no changes
        in math modes are done because (for example)  "v"  is  variable  in  math-mode,  no
        preposition.

-n     The  verbatim mode (\verb[char]...[char], \begtt...\endtt) is ignored, it means the
        program can do a changes in verbatim environment.  Default (without -n option):  no
        changes in verbatim mode are done.

-l     The   LaTeX   mode.  The  following  environments  are  treated  as  display  mode:
        \begin{display}...\end{display}  and  \begin{equation}...\end{equation}   and   the
        following       environment       is       treated      as      verbatim      mode:
        \begin{verbatim}...\end{verbatim}.

-w     The web mode (Knuth's web, no  www:-).
```

## Examples
```
vlna *.tex
        All files with .tex suffix in current directory will  be  processed  (and  possibly
        changed). (The "*" is UNIX-shell feature).

vlna -f file > /dev/null
        Only  the consistence checking of math and verbatim modes is processed.  No changes
        are done.
