# GLPK 4.65 (release date: Feb 16, 2018)

The following new API routines for LP/MIP preprocessing were
added:

* `glp_npp_alloc_wksp`  allocate the preprocessor workspace
* `glp_npp_load_prob`     load original problem instance
* `glp_npp_preprocess1`   perform basic LP/MIP preprocessing
* `glp_npp_build_prob`    build resultant problem instance
* `glp_npp_postprocess`   postprocess solution to resultant problem
* `glp_npp_obtain_sol`    obtain solution to original problem
* `glp_npp_free_wksp`     free the preprocessor workspace

See doc/npp.txt for detailed description of these API routines.

A new, more robust implementation of locally valid simple cover
cuts was included in the MIP solver.

The API routine `glp_init_iocp` was changed to enable long-step
option of the dual simplex by default.
