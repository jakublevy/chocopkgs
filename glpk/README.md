# GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit)

The GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) package is intended for solving large-scale linear programming (LP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and other related problems. It is a set of routines written in ANSI C and organized in the form of a callable library.

GLPK supports the GNU MathProg modeling language, which is a subset of the AMPL language.

The GLPK package includes the following main components:
* primal and dual simplex methods
* primal-dual interior-point method
* branch-and-cut method
* translator for GNU MathProg
* application program interface (API)
* stand-alone LP/MIP solver
