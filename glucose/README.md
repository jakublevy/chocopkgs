# The Glucose SAT Solver
Glucose is based on a new scoring scheme for the clause learning mechanism of so called "Modern" SAT solvers (it is based on [this paper](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/09/Papers/074.pdf)).

Glucose is designed to be parallel since 2014. The name of the Solver is a contraction of the concept of "glue clauses", a particular kind of clauses that glucose detects and preserves during search.
