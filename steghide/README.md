# Steghide
Steghide is a steganography program that is able to hide data in various kinds of image- and audio-files. The color- respectivly sample-frequencies are not changed thus making the embedding resistant against first-order statistical tests.

### Features
* compression of embedded data
* encryption of embedded data
* embedding of a checksum to verify the integrity of the extraced data
* support for JPEG, BMP, WAV and AU files
