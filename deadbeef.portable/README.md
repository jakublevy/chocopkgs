# DeaDBeeF
DeaDBeeF (as in [0xDEADBEEF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexspeak)) is a modular multiple-platform audio player for desktop operating systems.

DeaDBeeF lets you play variety of audio formats, convert between them, customize the UI almost any way you want, and use many [additional plugins](https://deadbeef.sourceforge.io/plugins.html) which can extend it even more.
