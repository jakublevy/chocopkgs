# Undark
Undark is a tool that will go through your entire SQLite database file and dump out all rows of data it finds still intact ( both current and deleted rows ). Undark does not differentiate between current and deleted data. The output of Undark is plain text CSV format.

This project is forked from http://pldaniels.com/undark.

**What Undark can do**:
* Retrieve most available records from a SQLite3 DB and dump them to stdout
* Dump normal (visible) records to stdout
* Dump deleted (unvacuumed) records to stdout
* Retrieve data from corrupted SQLite DBs (because it only examines data on a per record basis)

**What Undark can't do**:
* Recover data that's already been vacuumed out of the file
* Magically put the records back in to your db file


## Usage
```
undark -i {sqlite DB} [-d] [-v] [-V|--version]
	[--cellcount-min=count] [--cellcount-max=count] 
	[--rowsize-min=bytes] [--rowsize-max=bytes]
	[--no-blobs] [--blob-size-limit=bytes]
	[--fine-search]
        -i: input SQLite3 format database
        -d: enable debugging output (very large dumps)
        -v: enable verbose output
        -V|--version: show version of software
        -h|--help: show this help
        --cellcount-min: define the minimum number of cells a row must have to be extracted
        --cellcount-max: define the maximum number of cells a row must have to be extracted
        --rowsize-min: define the minimum number of bytes a row must have to be extracted
        --rowsize-max: define the maximum number of bytes a row must have to be extracted
        --no-blobs: disable the dumping of blob data
        --blob-size-limit: all blobs larger than this size are dumped to .blob files
        --fine-search: search DB shifting one byte at a time, rather than records
```
