# rush
A cross-platform command-line tool for executing jobs in parallel.

`rush` is a tool similar to [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel) and [gargs](https://github.com/brentp/gargs). `rush` borrows some idea from them and has some unique features, e.g., supporting custom defined variables, resuming multi-line commands, more advanced embeded replacement strings.

### For more information about rush see [the official README.md](https://github.com/shenwei356/rush/blob/master/README.md).
